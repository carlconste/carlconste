### Hello there! My name is Carlangelo (Carl) Conste. Nice to meet you!

- I recently graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a BA in Data Science, focusing on Business and Industrial Analytics.
- I'm interested in leveraging data to drive important business decision making using statistical analysis and machine learning models.
- My technical experience ranges from using Python for data analysis and developing models, SQL and MongoDB for data engineering, and Java for project development. For data analysis, I primarily use libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Plotly. Some machine learning frameworks I've worked with are scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow.
